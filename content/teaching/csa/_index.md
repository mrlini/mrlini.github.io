## Course requirements

### Seminar and lab activity:
- __Attendance__ (according to the regulations of the University and Faculty): 
	- __$\geq 75\\%$ compulsory for seminars__ activities, 
	- __$\geq 90\\%$ compulsory for lab__ activities . 
	- No exemption based on extra school activities (eg. job, etc.).

- Students __must participate__ at the seminar and laboratory with their assigned group/subgroup.

- Students with __more than 2 unmotivated absences__ at the seminar OR laboratory will not be able to take the exam in the normal session and or in the retake examination session (this is because seminar and laboratory activity are activities that take place on the following principle “activity along the semester”, and they can not be recovered or repeated for a possible retake examination). Students with medical certificates for each of their absences are exempted from this rule ([see here](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/hotarare-privind-motivarea-absentelor-studentilor-nivel-licenta/)).

Laboratory assignments:
-  Each lab, students will receive an assignmen twith an associated deadline. Bonus points are awarded for completing these assignments.
- Active participation is directly correlated with laboratory attendance, __meaning__: if the lab assignment is partially or fully completed, the student is considered present. Students who do not perform any activity in the laboratory will not be marked as present.

Grading policy for practical tests/exams:
- 0 = The student cannot answer questions about the code, or the solution solves a different problem.
- 1 = The assembly code has syntax errors or compilation errors/warnings.
- 4 = Runtime crash.
- 7 = All of the above are OK but the implementation is not quite complete
- 10 = Complete implementation and correct execution.

## For students who failed this course in the past and are taking it again this year:

- According to the faculty regulations, students who failed this course and are retaking it, must comply with all the requirements of the current promotion. As a result:
  - Until the 12th of October 2025 they must contact a teaching assistant and be included in a laboratory group.
  - __All rules/requirements presented above (course/seminar/lab/tests) also apply to students who are retaking the course__.
  - These students will be will be distributed evenly within the groups/subgroups to ensure an even workload.
  - Students will be consistent and will participate in the same time interval at the seminar and laboratory activities.
